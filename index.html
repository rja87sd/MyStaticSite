            About Me 
        </h2>
        <section>
            I am 36 years old, and a native of Louisiana. I was raised in the Baker/Zachary area, though I currently live in Baton
            Rouge. My favorite hobbies are gaming, be it video games or tabletop RPGs; reading, my favorite authors are J. R. R.
            Tolkien and Jim Butcher; writing, I love online role-playing; and listening to music, my favorite bands include Blind
            Guardian, Nightwish, Heilung, and Apocalyptica.
